# 0G_HackathonProject
Hackathon project where I used the Twilio and Google Maps API to get directions to a location without having any data.

Worked in conjunction with two other apps that connected to the Microsoft Translate API and Wikipedia API.

These tools combined to form the perfect tool for when a user needed information, had phone service but had no data connection.
